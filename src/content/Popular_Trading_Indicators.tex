\section{DISCLAIMERS}

In the discussion below, I will adopt the following conventions:  

\begin{itemize}
  \item Price data points may correspond to one of the following values:  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $O$: Open  
      \item $H$: High  
      \item $L$: Low  
      \item $C$: Close  
    \end{itemize}
  \item Unless explicitly specified, $P$ will serve as a placeholder for any of these price data points.
  \item Let $P$ represent a price value. The observed price at time $t$ is denoted as $P_t$, the price of the previous candle as $P_{t-1}$, and the price of the next candle as $P_{t+1}$.
  \item If not explicity specified, standard lookback period will have length of $n$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
    % ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %
    % Plot-Name: Indexing Line Explanation Plot                                %

    % Horizontal line
    \draw[thick, ->] (0,0) -- (13,0);

    % Ticks on line
    \foreach \x in {1.5, 3.5, 8, 10, 12} {
        \draw[thick] (\x,0.08) -- (\x,-0.08);
    }

    % Ticks labels
    \node[above] at (1.5,0) {$P_{t-n}$};
    \node[above] at (3.5,0) {$P_{t-n + 1}$};
    \node[above] at (5.75,0) {\ldots};
    \node[above] at (8,0) {$P_{t-2}$};
    \node[above] at (10,0) {$P_{t-1}$};
    \node[above] at (12,0) {$P_t$};

  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Now that we have clarified the conventions of notation and indexing system, let us proceed with the discussion of indicators.

\section{TREND INDICATORS}

\begin{definition} \textbf{Simple Moving Average - SMA} \\
Tool in financial analysis that computes the arithmetic mean of a security's price over a predetermined number of periods. By averaging past prices, the SMA smooths out price fluctuations, aiding in the identification of prevailing market trends.
\end{definition}

\vspace{-15pt}

$$ S\!M\!A_t(n) \, = \, \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \, P_{t - k} $$

\begin{definition} \textbf{Exponential Moving Average - EMA} \\
Weighted moving average that places greater importance on recent price data. The EMA is calculated by applying a smoothing factor to the previous period's EMA and the current period's price.
\end{definition}

\vspace{-10pt}

$$ 
E\!M\!A_t(n) \, = \, \alpha \cdot P_t \, + \, (1 - \alpha) \cdot E\!M\!A_{t-1}(n)
$$

\textit{It offers a more responsive average, reflecting current market trends more accurately.}

\vspace{-15pt}

$$
E\!M\!A_t \, = \, P_t \cdot ( \scalebox{1}{$\frac{\lambda}{n + 1}$}) \, + \, E\!M\!A_{t - 1} \cdot (\scalebox{1}{$1 - \frac{\lambda}{n + 1}$}), \quad \text{s.t.} \,\,\, \lambda \in (0, \, {n + 1}) 
$$

For \textit{smoothing factor}$ \,\, \scalebox{0.9}{$\alpha \coloneq \frac{\lambda}{1 + n}$} $, which stays \underline{constant} during calculation, the most common representation of $E\!M\!A$ with look back period $n$ at time $t$ is:
$$ E\!M\!A_t(n) \, = \, P_t \cdot \alpha \, + \, E\!M\!A_{t - 1}(n-1) \cdot (1 - \alpha ), \quad \text{s.t.} \,\,\, \alpha \in (0, \, 1) $$
Alternative non-recursive methodology, utilizing a functional series:
$$ E\!M\!A_t(n) = \alpha \cdot P_t + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 - \alpha)^k \cdot \alpha \cdot P_{t-k} $$
\textbf{Common settings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Look back period}: Longer term; $ n \in \{ 50, 200 \} $, \, Shorter term; $ n \in \{8, 20\}$
    \item \textit{Smoothing constant}: $\lambda = 2 $ (Determines the weighting of recent data points)
    \item \textit{Price data point}: $P_t = C_t$ (Closing price serves as standard, because it reflects the final consensus of value for that period after all trading has been completed.)
    \end{itemize}
\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Trend Identification}: If the price is above the EMA, it suggests an upward trend, indicating bullish market conditions. Conversely, if the price is below the EMA, it suggests a downward trend, indicating bearish conditions.
    \item \textit{Smoothens Price Data}:  Reduces market "noise" by smoothing out short-term fluctuations, offering a clearer view of the price trend.
    \end{itemize}
\textbf{Weaknesses:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Emphasizing Recent Price Action}: Overweighting recent dates creates a bias that leads to more false alarms. 
    \item \textit{Lagging Indicator}:  Since they are based on past prices, they can lag behind the current market, potentially leading to delayed signals.
\end{itemize}
